 ## Design

 ### Imagery 

 Skate Shacks imagery is massively important as it gives the user an instant vibe that they can relate to in such venues letting them feel like this is the skatepark for them. Big vibrant colours with graffiti in urban settings that make a skater feel at home. 

 ### Colours 

 Skate Shacks colours are chosen to fit in with the urban skate scene with concrete greys for the background with flourishes of colour for points of interest. An overall monochrome pallette fits with the urban vibe.

 ### Font 

 The font used for Skate Shack is Roboto. This is simple, sleek and easy to read reflecting the urban and busy feel to the rest of the page. Sans Serif is used as a backup font.
